Setup
-----

1. Install GNU Social

2. Put all files in /plugins/Qvitter

3. Add `addPlugin('Qvitter');` to your /config.php file.

4. There are a few settings in /plugins/Qvitter/QvitterPlugin.php. By default Qvitter is 
opt-out for users. If you set `$settings['enabledbydefault'] = false;` Qvitter will
be opt-in instead.

5. Users can go to ://{instance}/settings/qvitter and enable or disable Qvitter.

NOTE: Qvitter is now a plugin for GNU Social. There will probably be bugs because of
this change.
