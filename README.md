Setup
-----

You need a webserver with PHP support.

Edit settings.php.

(Qvitter uses a slightly modified statusnet API. Some things will not work
if you connect to a site with standard API. Files are included if you want
to Qvitter-mod your Statusnet API.)
   

TODO
----

1. Join _new_ external groups and follow _new_ external users ("New" meaning users/groups that the server don't know yet) 

2. Auto suggest mentions 

3. Register

4. Background image uploading/editing

5. Color theme

6. Auto url-shortening setting under queet box

7. Settings (e.g. don't show replies to people I don't follow)

8. Syntax-coloring in queet-box, maybe codemirror (worked nicely for ltr but not rtl text when I tried it)

9. Image/file upload, drag-n-drop!

10. Search users

11. Recommended users

12. Filters (hide queets containing strings, e.g. mute users)

13. Better responsive design

14. More languages

15. Queet-page

16. New api for serving _number_ of new items in several streams (to show number of new items in menu/history) 

17. New "expand queet" api for getting conversation, retweets, favs and attachment in the same request 

18. DMs

19. Node.js long polling server and an new api that serve aggregate of all polling users requests in one go
